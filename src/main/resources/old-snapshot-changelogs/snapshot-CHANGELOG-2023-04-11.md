## New Recipes
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyList](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/dependencies/dependencylist): Emits a data table detailing all Gradle and Maven dependencies.This recipe makes no changes to any source file. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.RemoveOauth2LoginConfig](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/removeoauth2loginconfig): `oauth2Login()` is a Spring Security feature that allows users to authenticate with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider. When a user is authenticated using this feature, they are granted a set of authorities that determines what actions they are allowed to perform within the application. In Spring Security 5, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider via `oauth2Login()` is `ROLE_USER`. This means that the user is allowed to access the application's resources as a regular user. However, in Spring Security 6, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 provider is `OAUTH2_USER`, and the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OpenID Connect 1.0 provider is `OIDC_USER`. These authorities are more specific and allow for better customization of the user's permissions within the application. If you are upgrading to Spring Security 6 and you have previously configured a `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` to handle the authorities of users authenticated via `oauth2Login()`, you can remove it completely as the new default authorities should be sufficient. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.RemoveUseAuthorizationManager](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/removeuseauthorizationmanager): In Spring Security 6, <websocket-message-broker> defaults use-authorization-manager to true.  So, the 'use-authorization-manager' attribute for message security is no longer needed and can be removed. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.UpdateEnableReactiveMethodSecurity](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/updateenablereactivemethodsecurity): In Spring security 6.0, `@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity` defaults `useAuthorizationManager` to true. So, to complete migration, `@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity` remove the `useAuthorizationManager` attribute. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.UpdateRequestCache](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/updaterequestcache): By default, Spring Security 5 queries the saved request on every request, which means that in a typical setup, the HttpSession is queried on every request to use the RequestCache. In Spring Security 6, the default behavior has changed, and RequestCache will only be queried for a cached request if the HTTP parameter "continue" is defined. To maintain the samuel e default behavior as Spring Security 5, either explicitly add the HTTP parameter "continue" to every request or use NullRequestCache to override the default behavior. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.MigrateAssumptions](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/testing/junit5/migrateassumptions): Many of JUnit 4's `Assume#assume(..)` methods have no direct counterpart in JUnit 5 and require Hamcrest JUnit's `MatcherAssume`. 

## Changed Recipes
