## New Recipes
* [org.openrewrite.FindGitProvenance](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/findgitprovenance): List out the contents of each unique `GitProvenance` marker in the set of source files. When everything is working correctly, exactly one such marker should be printed as all source files are expected to come from the samuel e repository / branch / commit hash. 
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.search.DependencyInsight](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/search/dependencyinsight): Find direct and transitive dependencies matching a group, artifact, and optionally a configuration name.Results include dependencies that either directly match or transitively include a matching dependency. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.recipes.FindRecipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/recipes/findrecipes): This recipe finds all OpenRewrite recipes, primarily to produce a data table that is being used to experiment with fine-tuning a large language model to produce more recipes.
