## New Recipes

* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.RelocatedDependencyCheck](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/dependencies/relocateddependencycheck): Find Maven and Gradle dependencies and Maven plugins that have relocated to a new `groupId` or `artifactId`. Relocation information comes from the [oga-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/oga-maven-plugin/) maintained by Jonuel  Lermitage, Filipe Roque and others.

This recipe makes no changes to any source file by default. Add `changeDependencies=true` to change dependencies, but note that you might need to run additional recipes to update imports and adopt other breaking changes. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.MXBeanRule](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/mxbeanrule): Sets visibility of MBean and MXBean interfaces to public. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.guava.PreferJavaStringJoin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/guava/preferjavastringjoin): Replaces supported calls to `com.google.common.base.Joiner#join()` with `java.lang.String#join()`. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MissingOptionExample](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/recipes/missingoptionexample): Find `@Option` annotations that are missing `example` values for documentation. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.recipes.RecipeEqualsAndHashCodeCallSuper](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/recipes/recipeequalsandhashcodecallsuper): Recipes are value objects, so should use `@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)`. While in most cases recipes do not extend other classes and so the option is moot, as a matter of stylistic consistency and to enforce the idea that recipes are value objects, this value should be set to `false`. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.SpringBoot3BestPractices](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/spring/boot3/springboot3bestpractices): Applies best practices to Spring Boot 3 applications. 
* [org.openrewrite.micrometer.dropwizard.FindDropwizardMetrics](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/micrometer/dropwizard/finddropwizardmetrics): Find uses of Dropwizard metrics that could be converted to a more modern metrics instrumentation library. 

## Removed Recipes

* **org.openrewrite.java.migrate.MXBeanNonPublic**: Sets visibility of MBean and MXBean interfaces to public. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateJavaTemplateToRewrite8**: Migrate `JavaTemplate` to accommodate Rewrite 8, due to wide open-ended usage of JavaTemplate, this recipe just apply most of common changes to pass compile and will leave some comments to require human's review. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateMarkersSearchResult**: Methods of `org.openrewrite.marker.Markers#SearchResult(..)` are deprecated and removed in rewrite 8, use `SearchResult.found()` instead. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateRecipeToRewrite8**: Rewrite Recipe Migration to version 8. While most parts can be automatically migrated, there are some complex and open-ended scenarios that require manual attention. In those cases, this recipe will add a comment to the code and request a human to review and handle it manually. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateTestToRewrite8**: Since the method `Recipe::doNext(..)` is deprecated, For unit test, change usage like `RecipeSpec.recipe(X.doNext(Y))` to `RecipeSpec.recipes(X, Y)`. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.RemoveApplicabilityTestFromYamlRecipe**: Removes any-source applicability tests from YAML recipes, as the are no longer supported in Rewrite 8 and migrates single-source applicability tests to preconditions. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedPackageClassName**: When a class moved from package A to B, update the fully qualified className accordingly. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedRecipe**: If a recipe moved between packages, update the code reference places, declarative recipes, and `activeRecipes` in pom.xml. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedRecipeXml**: Update moved package recipe in pom.xml. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedRecipeYaml**: Update moved package recipe in yaml file. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.upgrade.MigrateToRewrite8**: Migrate rewrite recipe and test from version 7 to version 8.
While most parts can be automatically migrated, there are some complex and open-ended scenarios that require manual attention.
In those cases, this recipe will add a comment to the code and request a human to review and handle it manually.

* **org.openrewrite.java.upgrade.UpdateStaticAnalysisPackage**: Some recipes have been moved from `rewrite` to `rewrite-static-analysis`, so any referencing places should update the class package name accordingly. 
* **org.openrewrite.kotlin.StaticAnalysis**: Static analysis fixes for Kotlin sources.
